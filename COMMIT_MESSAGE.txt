Fix Telegram setup session synchronization issue

Problem:
After successful Telegram authorization, users experienced a "setup required" 
loop when reloading the page instead of being properly redirected to contacts.

Root cause:
- telegram_authorized flag was set in DB but not reliably persisted in Flask session
- index() function didn't sync session with DB value
- login() always reset telegram_authorized to False regardless of DB value
- Missing explicit completion message from API

Solution:
1. Added explicit session.modified = True in verify_telegram_code(), telegram_auth(), 
   and login() to ensure Flask persists session changes
2. Implemented session/DB synchronization in index() - DB is source of truth
3. Changed login() to initialize session from DB value instead of always False
4. Added explicit "Setup completed" message in verify_code API response
5. Implemented missing verifyPassword() function in frontend
6. Added comprehensive logging for debugging session state

Changes:
- app.py: Enhanced session persistence and DB sync in index(), login(), 
  telegram_auth(), and verify_telegram_code()
- templates/telegram_auth.html: Use API message, implement verifyPassword()

Result:
- Session and DB stay synchronized
- Page reloads correctly redirect to contacts after authorization
- Clear completion message displayed to users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

Acceptance criteria met:
✅ "Setup completed" message appears after successful authorization
✅ Page reload redirects to contacts (no setup loop)
✅ Explicit logging of telegram_authorized flag changes
✅ index() checks and syncs both session and DB
